He was a nightmare for California and San Francisco. 
He was and still is the most feared and mysterious serial killer there ever was. 
Although he sent letters to the police, press and even had an interview, 
he was never identified and he was never stopped. 
I will not let his work be forgotten and I will carry on his legacy myself. 

However, times have changed. Now, I challenge you to outsmart me! Do that and I will consider letting you live. Fail - and you will face my wrath! 

Do you dare to venture deep into my father's work?

Let’s take a stroll down memory lane, shall we:
When I was a kid my father used to take me on long drives near a lake. We always pulled over in two spots and paid respect to my father's work. Because, you see, it is in these two spots that he attacked some people and claimed their souls going completely <span>WIKI</span>d. The first site was David and Betty, the second Michael and Darlene. 

I want you to examine daddy’s favorite area a bit better. There are woods, creeks, lakes and roads. Some roads in this area are so small that they don’t even have a name. 
Tell me, when you drive from the location of the first murder to the location of the second murder, what is the first named road you come across on your right?

I remember him talking to himself, saying numbers and knocking on the table, like a madman. I was so impressed. Once, he asked me to draw what he was saying. Can you do that for me? 
Or do it for yourself if it makes it easier... 

Don’t forget to get a piece of paper and a pen.

I can remember that only two days before Apollo 12 was launched, a local newspaper published an article about daddy’s letter written to the public. 
He sent the letter with the purpose to let everyone know how many people he had killed. 

How many victims did he claim at that moment?

The <span>police</span> were expecting him to make a mistake, but dad was smart and didn’t <span>say</span> too much. 
Weeks later everyone was still talking about it. That was one of the most exciting <span>calls</span> in TV history and best of all… the police <span>never traced</span> the call.

Pause the video anywhere between 0:10 and 0:40
Get a pen and paper ready.

Look at the words ZODIAC KILLER on the paused screen.
